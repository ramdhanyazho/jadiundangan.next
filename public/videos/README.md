# Cinematic preview video placeholder

The cinematic preview pages default to `/videos/cinematic.mp4`. The repository
intentionally leaves this file out so you can drop in any short looping clip
locally without committing large binaries. Add your own `cinematic.mp4` to this
folder when running the previews in development.
